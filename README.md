# This is not only for YouTube viewing:
You can use this `YT MultiView Master` for opening any kind of `website`. *I named it YT MultiView Master mainly because I use it for YouTube*, but it's versatile and can be used for any purpose.

# How to Use YT MultiView Master:
- **Download and Install:** First, ensure you have Python installed on your system. Then, download the `YT MultiView Master` script and save it in any location.

- **Launch the Script:** Run the` YT MultiView Master` script in your command prompt or terminal using:
```bash
    python yt_multiview_master.pyw
```

- **Enter Website Link:** Upon running the script, you'll be prompted to enter the link of the website you want to open in multiple windows. Simply `type or paste the URL`.

- **Specify Window Count:** Next, enter the number of windows you want to open for the specified website. For instance, *if you input "`4` and press the `start button`," four windows will be launched with the same website.*

# Note:
- **Desktop Exclusive:** *Please note that* `YT MultiView Master` is designed specifically for use on `desktop` or `laptop computers` and may not function properly on `mobile` devices or `phones`.

- **Thread Usage Notice:** As `YT MultiView Master` utilizes `threading` to open multiple windows simultaneously, it may exert additional `pressure on your system`, particularly on devices with lower configurations. Exercise caution when using the tool and ensure your system can handle the load.

- **VPN Extension Included:** For added convenience, a `VPN extension` has been integrated into all `opened windows`. Feel free to use it effortlessly to enhance your browsing experience.
